# Hotel Reservations
## Project Context
This project is the backend logic of a hotel reservation management system. It utilizes **classes**, **arrays**, and **dynamic memory** to provide a **functional system**. The program allows users to **add** rooms, **request** reservations, and **view** details of existing rooms and reservations. It includes features such as checking room availability, matching specific criteria for room selection, and managing reservation dates so that they do not overlap each other. The application is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing a reliable solution for hotel room management.
 
## Project Learning Goals Achieved
- Understand the basics of **classes**, **arrays**, and **static and dynamic memory** in **C++**.
- Learn how to **create** and **populate classes**, use functions and constructors effectively, and provide a working Makefile.
- Gain experience in **array manipulation** and implementing **application logic**.
